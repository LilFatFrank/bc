a distributed data storage consisting of containers(blocks) which are connected
each container holds the ledger

a single block can hold any data you want... for crypto, it can be a list of transactions

a blockchain has multiple blocks and they know about each other. each block is hashed that is generated from all the parts that make up the block.
the hash generated for the first block is stored by use the next block to generate the hash for the next block
same input = same output. no other input leads to the same hash.

cryptocurrency uses blockchain. if the data you store in a block is a list of transactions, the coins transferred in the transactions form your cryptocurrecy 
coins are transferred with transactions
changing them into other currencies is not possible inside the blockchain
the value of a coin is determined by the value the participants of the blockchain network assign to it (i.e. what you're willing to pay in 'real' currencies).
coins are created via mining. mining is adding new blocks to the chain. they have to solve an algorithm(let's say calculate hash)

a blockchain runs on multiple machines called nodes

a wallet is a node, it enables you to send or receive coins. it can act as an identification of you. send and receive coins
a new transaction created is broadcasted with other notes.  transactions are verified. one node bundles them up in a new block and then inform otherblocks and is added in the network

in the end, A DISTRIBUTED DATA STORAGE NETWORK.

you will work with data all the time in python

a chain in the end is a list (a special type of data in python)
